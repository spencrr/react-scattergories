# React Scattergories

## What?

Bored during a public health crisis with friends/family on video chat and nothing to do? Look no further than React Scattergories!

By entering a room id, you all can share the same list! Shuffle through until you find one you like and play! Timer and scoring sold separately (scoring coming soon!).

I built this extremely quickly so that we would have something to play, as well as an experimentation project with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/).

On the front-end, React handles DOM manipulation and sends API requests to the back-end Node server running [express](https://expressjs.com/).

## How?

Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then run:
```sh

git clone "github.com/spencrr/react-scattergories"

cd react-scattergories

npm install

npm run build

npm run start
```
